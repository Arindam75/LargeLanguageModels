It was my second day and was still driving it around and enjoying my vacation.    Was not aware of all the functions on the key controls.   Just lock and unlock.  I must have accidentally hit the open truck key and was not aware of it beenopen.  There was no beeping sound or flashing alert on the dash like my Toyota van.  I drove the car out of the car port and the trunk window got shattered because it was to high.   I believe this to be a design default.    My lost"

And if sitting idling in gear with running lights or what is called driving light which are automatically on they will flicker continuously. ( another thing they cant find). Fuel mileage is nothing like advertising says. Ours doing the math miles driven vrs gallons used will alot of the times be 16 to 17. Never seen it even close to what the dash says. 25.xx miles per gallon. Yes they will warranty it but they keep telling us its normal operations. My advice dont buy one.

Took to dealer and was told they had to update the computer and was also told to NEVER use E85 even-though it is rated to use it, I told them that I had never used the E85 and was only using premium gas, I was then told that premium gas was as bad as E85 and causes the computer to act up. I was told to only use regular unleaded fuel and in a couple of tanks it should work itself out, well three tanks later is is not as bad as it was but it still acts up almost daily. What a POS, I have always been a Dodge Guy but wish I hadn't bought this one. Only getting 13 mpg in city and 19 or 20 on highway and I only have about 2,100 miles on it (yes that is actually 2,100 miles), I am about to trade it in on a Chevy or Ford..................................................."

Example in video for NE 21st says Nebraska (I live in Oregon) because the street direction NE is the state abreviation for Nebraska. Been working with Dodge and the dealership for the past 3 months with no resolution. This happens with any street that is NE or SE followed by a number address. Dodge tells me there is NO fix. I drove other chargers including 2018 and they all do the same thing. The entire panasonic nav is faulty and I paid for navigation that does not work! I am a Realtor and use nav daily and am very unhappy Dodge cant find a fix and has told me I am out of luck. Also they are selling all cars with faulty navigation without disclosing to potential buyers of this uncorrectable fix. Wondered if anyone else is having this issue with Nav and if your dealership is doing anything about it?"

        "review": " My wife and I reserved a \"premium car\" (meaning full-size) with Alamo for our trip in Northern California.  When we got on the lot our choices were an Impala, a Lacrosse, and the Charger.  I was leaning towards the Lacrosse as it appeared to be trimmed nicer with a leather package.  My wife, however was drawn to the Charger's looks.  She was right -- even just being the STX, it did have a commanding presence, and from what I had heard, I figured the V6 power and the Charger's handling might be better on the curvy and mountainous roads we would be traveling on -- so we went with the Charger.  First off, getting situated was fine -- the trunk was very spacious, I easily paired my phone to the Bluetooth for music and gps, and we both got comfortably situated in our seats.  My first complaint, however, was that there was no back-up camera -- how does a full size car with not the greatest rear-view vision not have this as standard equipment in this modern era? In driving from the Oakland airport to Napa Valley, and around Napa Valley, the car functioned as expected, and I was pleased (except for the lack of the rear-view camera).  The next stage of our trip led us further north, to the Redwoods, including some travelling through very curvy roads and in the mountains.  Here the Charger fell short of my expectations.  I should state, my regular car is an Optima SX Turbo -- and while it is no true performance car, it does well, and is fun to drive in such situations.  The Charger, on the other hand, did not quite have the acceleration I am accustomed to, nor the tighter handling around the curves (granted, it is bigger than my Optima).  It drove more like the traditional full size cars I'd driven, and less like the sporty Charger I expected (perhaps that handling is there on the pricier V8 trims).  Still, all in all, it was not bad -- I've driven much worse in similar situations.  We drove the car for over a week and more that 1000 miles, and up until near the end we were for the most part happy with the car.  But the day before we returned the car, the Bluetooth stopped working -- we spent a good amount of time and several ideas trying to resolve the problem, but nothing would work -- very frustrating."

Cloth type fabric seats were ok but non-ventilated and lacking the overall comfort of the leather or suede seats other Challengers have.  Front A Pillars will challenge you to 'see' in front of you.  Backing up is all but impossible without the Back Up Camera on the 8.4 Screen.  The overall performance was as expected and put a smile on my face.  Clutch force was agreeable with my old knees.  Excellent Electronics and Nav. I guess the ONLY real issue I have with this All American Muscle Car Icon is that the Engine and Transmissions are Made in Mexico.  Then, because of NAFTA, Fiat gets to ship them to Canada where the Challenger is assembled and then shipped to America for $1,047 that the Consumer has to pay.  My Ram 4x4 was made in America with a Hemi Engine but American Transmission and drive train BEFORE Fiat took over Chrysler.  So, FIAT now owns Chrysler/Dodge/Ram/Jeep and builds them between Mexico and Canada (some in America) and sells them here in America for $49,757 before tax, tag, and title...  No thanks...I hope President Trump pulls us out of NAFTA.  God Bless American Jobs and American Workers."

With a 3.6 L V6 that allows flex fuel as well as normal fuel, this van can really go if you give it the right amount of power, although the engine has a bit of a lag at first. The startup is fairly quiet, but running vibrations while the van is in the park gear can annoying. The location gear shifter is a bit odd, but the dashboard is straightforward. Good local car, but lacks entertainment feature that would make long rod trips pleasant. Mileage is about 17 in the city and 24 on the highway. A fuel economy mode is available on certain models."

That truck caused me to have to walk no less than 50 miles in my life due to break downs, so when I grew up I promised myself that I would never own a Dodge until I saw the Hellcat and did a test drive in own, unfortunately I had to let the salesman know that there was no way that I could possibly buy the Hellcat as if I did I would be arrested within 4 hours for excessive speeding, or worse. So he introduced me to the 2017 Scat pack, not quite the Hellcat but she can get the job done when I want her to, there are issues like Dodge not releasing parts for it so I can add the remote starter and the 4g internet, I am about to file a lemon law claim against Dodge based upon that issue."

        "review": " Rented this car for a trip to Vegas.  V6 basic car.  First impressions were very touchy brakes but you get used to it.  Power for passing on 2 lanes very good.  Handling very good even on worn stock tires.  Gas mileage was way better than I expected.  Whole tank netted 35+ mpg at legal and above speeds on 2 lane roads thru desert over 2 mountain passes and thru one town rush hour.  Just as a test from state line to downtown Vegas, pulled to slow lane on I-15, set cruise to 70, and netted 45 mpg for 40 miles.  For other reviews about this car complaining about mileage, drive sensibly, anticipate slow downs and red lights and don't buy low profile, wide wheels and tires.  Other comments are rather cheap looking instrument panel.  Readouts on computer lettering could be larger.  Only power cord outlet in console cubby.  Makes for a long power cord stretch for my Garmin in left corner windshield.  My recommendation for a daily driver and long trips, buy a base V6, upgrade to nicer seats with more power adjustments and go for a back-up camera."

Simply gorgeous/brutal looks, active exhaust sounds killer, acceleration (375 hp) is something else. Huge moon roof. Six-speed stick feels great in the hand, and works fine. Gas mileage: forget it. Handling: forget it. Rear visibility: forget it. But a trunk (with fold-down rear seats) for the ages, even with the OPTIONAL ($300) spare tire.  Dwarfs WRXs, BMWs; same size as a Cadillac CTS. At 4400 lbs, it ain't lithe. If you want handling, buy an angular Camaro or a humdrum Mustang. If you want the ultimate evolution of the classic '60's muscle car, with a sound and straightline pull that will get your attention, buy a Challenger."

I have no complaints except to say that there are gives and gets with such a sleek body style...and you have to take the bad with the good.  My only suggestion is to please reintroduce something that's been missing for years from Dodge muscle cars - namely, the hood mounted directional signals.  Yes, i know, they were a styling feature on the charger, but they made these cars so distinctively Dodge that they are always sought-after by buyers of old Chargers   First, are they intact, and second....do they still work?  Agreed, this feature adds nothing to the functionality or safety of the vehicle (similar to sequential directional signals offered by Ford), but they're so darn cool...and so darn Mopar!   I swear, if they were offered on new Challengers, I'd trade my 2014 in on a new one.  How shallow and immature is that?  But then again, isn't that what's it's all about?"

        "review": " Note: I have an R/T (5.7L), not a Scat Pack. I'm not sure why that was selected for my review. I'm a 40-something-year-old dad with teenaged kids. I've been driving an Avalanche for the past 6 years and it's served me well. But I wanted to move back to a car rather than a truck. I knew I wanted a big sedan. I had been looking at Chargers for a long time. Everything else in its class seemed kind of bland. I had never owned a Dodge product but I really liked the styling of the new Chargers, and the availability of a V8 made them that more interesting. A couple of months ago, one of my other cars went into the dealer for a recall. They sent me to Enterprise for a complimentary rental. Enterprise picked me up in what I would learn was a 2017 Charger. I got into the passenger side and the woman from Enterprise started it up. The exhaust growl got my attention immediately. I asked her what exactly this thing was - it was an R/T. Sadly, this was not to be my rental car. But they did give me a 2017 AWD Charger with the 3.6L VVT engine. After driving that for a few weeks, I was hooked. I'm going to preface the rest of my comments by reminding you that we're talking about a full-sized sedan. Acceleration was great, handling was precise and braking was awesome. Cabin space is generous and the seats are comfortable. The UConnect system is intuitive and comprehensive. After turning my rental in, I was on the hunt for a 2017 R/T. The color had to be Maximum Steel Metallic and it had to have the Blacktop package. I found one a couple of weeks later and have owned it a couple of weeks now. The 5.7L Hemi vs. the 3.6L VVT experience is night and day. The active exhaust on the R/T is sophisticated and sounds sweet. The 8-speed transmission behaves totally different behind the 5.7L vs. the 3.6L. In both cases, however, shifts are smooth and quick. The Android Auto feature baked into the UConnect is nice. I haven't tried the Apple version. The car I bought has very few options, but that's the way I like it. As equipped - just the R/T package and Blacktop option - it does everything I want it to do. It can be a docile 4 cylinder when commuting to work, or you can push the Sport button and let it rumble. Now the cons...there are a few things that my Avalanche does that the Charger does not. First, the ability to program the passenger seat heater to come on with a remote start. Charger doesn't do that. The Charger does not dip the right-side mirror when backing either, which is a nice feature that other cars have. My only other complaint is that the factory Firestone Firehawk GT tires really suck in cold weather. They're marketed as an all season tire but they are totally ineffective in the cold and snow. I've owned A LOT of V8, RWD cars over the years and have driven them in the Winter without issue. This Charger is completely helpless in inclement weather and I blame the tires. I'll be investing in dedicated Winter tires next season."

Mixed driving is 23 - 24.  Technology it is the bomb.  The connect system is quick and responsive and very well laid out.

Definitely get a V8 if you actually want to enjoy the drive, the V6 will never compare. Gas mileage in actual practice is lower than it was projected with factory setup. Car will feel slippery in the cold but that's because they decided to put 245s on them, definitely upgrade ASAP."

We then drove the caravan- which was very smooth- absorbing bumps with ease, smooth acceleration, nice features, comfortable seats, and lower cost than the Pacifica. Granted, we did like the look of the interior dash in the Pacifica better- it did feel like you were driving a very large vehicle (and I drive a semi) we then drove the 2016 Kia Sedona, and our backs were hurting before we were finished with the test drive. We felt clostrophobic in the front of the Sedona. The Sedona is a bit longer than the caravan, but the front feels cramped, while there is a little more legroom in the back seats. We went into this shopping trip with 2 different vehicles in mind. The Pacifica, and the Sedona- we ended up liking the Dodge Grand Caravan so much more! Interior feels like it\u2019s built to last, quality is great, design wonderful. *fyi- I\u2019ve never been a fan of Dodge, but the stow-n-go option really made me consider it- I\u2019m glad I did! One thing about the Caravan that is disappointing is the infotainment screen. Feels a bit like the screens from cell phones many years ago. Back up camera leaves much to be desired, as it is pretty grainy, and at night- it\u2019s just about worthless. However, it is a touchscreen, and it is a decent size. The Sedona had a very small screen. If you can look past the quality of the screen, then definitely take a look at the 2017 Dodge Grand Caravan! Ours has leather/suede seats."

        "review": " I bought the minivan for its space to haul my mobility scooter.  I installed a hoist and the scooter fits perfect.  I never use the last row of seating and carry a load of 400 lbs. at all times.  Looking at the van from the outside you can\u2019t even tell it has anything inside.  I love the power and the sound of the engine when you put your foot into it. The start has a little lag but then it takes off like a rocket, I had a big SUV before which weighed 1500 lbs. more than the van and it had the same horse power and it would not get out of its own way. I live in Phoenix, AZ so the remote start is a must in the hot weather.  I start it when I get outside of the store and the time I get my scooter loaded and get in the driver seat the A/C has it cooled down.  The auto doors are the best for loading groceries don\u2019t even have to get off my scooter.  I have people see me unloading my scooter and they always come over to help me close the rear door and I tell them it\u2019s automatic and push the button.    The Bluetooth for the phone is great calling and receiving calls, I like music and was always shuffling cd\u2019s in my old vehicle but this one puts them on the hard drive and then I never have to mess with them anymore. The mileage is good on the highway (26 MPG) in town I can\u2019t keep my foot out of it so not that great, but that\u2019s my own fault.  I\u2019m 62 and have had a lot of vehicles and this by far is the best."

        "review": " We rented this model last year for a trip that required lots of storage room for the trip home. We were instantly converted to a minivan household! Due to an unfortunate accident (not our fault) in November, it did provide us with the opportunity to buy a new car. We didn\u2019t even have to discuss it. We already knew what we wanted.  I searched online for a 2017nmodel, and bought it over the phone in less than an hour. When my husband\u2019s workday ended, he dropped off our other car to have the brakes relined, and got a lift from a friend straight to Landmark in Athens. He drove our new car home after signing the paperwork. Great financing, great customer service! I am handicapped which makes entering and exiting a car difficult. But because the Grand Caravan sits lower than our crossover, it\u2019s much easier for me know. Plus there is room for my wheelchair if needed. And the power out;ets allow me to use my medical while in transit so I can withstand longer road trips. So much storage space with all seats in position. If we stow all the seats, we can slide a queen size mattress and box springs in the back with room left over!  Love the separate temperatur controls in the front and rear. Rides like a car, storage room of a pickup and that v6 squeals the wheels when you have to go NOW. We weren\u2019t picky...this was the last 2017 model left on the lot so we had no hcoice in color of van, carpet or rest of interior. Missing s power package we would like to have (seats, doors, tailgate), but otherwise it\u2019s fabulous. And have you ever heard of getting 25mpg on surface streets? And we get 31mpg on the expressway. The economy fuel setting helps us achieve that. LOVE the Dodge Grand Caravan! And our rapidly growing teenager finally has room for his super long legs!  Cant say enough nice things about the car or Landmark Dodge. Just a great experience all the way around."

My wife is retiring this coming June and we are going to take the Challenger on the road and hope to see a good bit of this wonderful country...  Just a quick update on the ol' Challenger.....Still runs great, looks great, very comfortable....Have had one recall on it for a soft ware update and other than that we are good to go...Went up to Atlanta and back to Jacksonville with my son-in-law to pick his truck, as he and my daughter and their two kids have moved back from Kodiak Al......We ran between 75 and 80 on the interstate and got 31 mpg....."

        "review": " I leased a 2017 Dodge Challenger SXT. I wanted a challenger for many reasons but ultimately I was turned on by the 30mpg claim.  However, the only time I am able to get 30mpg is on the highway going down a hill.  I tried driving like a grandma for a day, super slow take offs and using several miles to accelerate to top speed but the best the computer showed was 25mpg.  And, that's terrible to drive like that, its way to slow and people were constantly going around me which indicated it was slower than a normal person would drive.  I have the high gloss black 20\" rims and the car has the 3.07 gears so maybe that's what's doing it but that's doubtful because at 70mph I'm under 2k RPMs and the instant tells me 22mpg.  So I don't know how they made that claim for 550 miles to the tankful but I have 500 miles on the car and have had to fill up twice already.  It leaves me wondering if I should of just got the R/T if I am going to get this bad of gas mileage but the dealership I went to didn't have an R/T on the lot. Next gripe was the GPS.  Sure it works as it should but its not Google (yes you can hook google up from your phone).   The stock GPS sent me on a 4.5 hour drive to get somewhere that's only 1 hour away.  I have no idea why it keeps telling me to get off the highway and then immediately get back on, it makes no sense.  So now I plug my phone in and only use Google GPS.  As far as driving it goes, it rides smooth and you can't feel it shifting which is pleasant.  Road nose is at a minimum.  Acceleration is what you would expect from a 3.6L, no big surprises there.  The trunk is huge, back seats are roomy.    As far as looking out of the car for blind-spots and other things, your visibility is great and I don't feel like there are any real danger zones around it. It is a big car but the only time it feels big is when I have to park it in a tight space, other than that it handles great and is a lot of fun to drive.  Overall, I wished I would of got the R/T for the extra power but I am happy with the lease and will more than likely turn it in for the R/T at the end of this 3 year lease."

        "review": " First of all I hate minivans.  I can't stand the look of any of them.  I wonder why they just don't put sliding doors or SUV's but anyway.  I went to the dealership to get a family car with 3rd row seating.  The problem I have is that I have 2 babies and 2 elementary age kids and SUV's aren't to car seat friendly when it comes to space.  I must have looked through 10 SUV's.  Looked great on the outside but lacked what I needed on the inside.  My son was like \"want to check out the dodge grand caravan\" and I was like what other choice to I have.  He pulled around a black DGC SXT fully loaded.  auto start, power sliding doors, power rear door, sound system out of this world, Bluetooth, hands free calling, deep bass.  When I sat on the inside it had leather seating with suede.  I feel in love with the inside of the vehicle.  I like to feel a little manly in my vehicles and this dodge grand caravan gave me just what I needed.  I didn't want to look like a soccer mom.  With 280HP under the hood it doesn't hesitate one bit when stepping on the accelerator.  I was not expecting this van to peel out like it did.  I was shocked.  So then I took it on a handling test.  I drive a 2016 ford fusion 2.0 Turbo and I felt like I was driving my car around.  I got to keep my dude card and be able to take my entire family around of 6 people comfortably. I'm no minivan connoisseur and I'm sure to minivan enthusiast this may not be there first or second option.  But I see the new 2017 dodge grand caravan as a crossover minivan SUV combo.  For men that want that look and you know the look I'm taking about.  A vehicle that looks aggressive this minivan has great potential on the aftermarket just because it is a Dodge.  So when people look over at my minivan, they are confused.  It looks masculine and with 20\" pickup truck wheels it puts this vehicle in it's very own category that hasn't been touched.  Kind of like the Ford Flex."

        "review": " I knew exactly what I wanted when I purchased my dodge challenger.  I had been looking at the body style since it came back on the market in 2012. I had seen the reviews about it being difficult to see out of and the blind spots and how heavy the car was all the negative stuff. But I remember the dodge challenger form the the early 70's when it was a sexy beast of a muscle car. Then I saw the cars of the later 70's turned into big square blocks of metal and then all of the years of seeing the Honda and the Toyota's rule the road. So when American Muscle started showing back up (even American Muscle made by a french Company out of Mexican Parts in Canada) I got excited. When I finally saw my 2017 challenger with the scat pack, in Yellow Jacket Yellow with black tail stripes and leather interior. I had to have to it. From the moment that I pushed the start button and heard that 6.4 liter rumble to life I got a permanent smile on my face. Since I learned how to drive in the 60's I knew how to adjust my mirrors to eliminate blind spots. You can push the sports mode button and the steering stiffens up enough that you can feel the road properly. The active exhaust sounds so freakin' good that you find your self tuning down the 650 watt alpine sound system to listen to the engines music.  The uconnect is intuitive and it almost links your devices to itself. The performance pages give you the option of seeing detailed workings of your car as you cruise and the timers let you keep track of your performance. Plus the launch control and the the programmable features that allow you change the way the car shifts, the stiffness of the steering and other controls makes the care flexible for various conditions.  I didn't buy this car hoping for any kind of fuel economy, hell I don't care if everytime that I push the start button someone goes out on the tundra and clubs a baby seal to death. I bought this car because it is a beautiful evil wicked beast that is fun to drive and it makes me happy. If you buy one of these cars for any reason other than that then you will most likely end up bitching and whining about something. If you are a skinny jean wearing half caff/decaff latte drinker you won't like this car. But if you like to feel the road, hear the rumble of an engine, and feel the g-forces push you back in the seat then this is your dream car"

The six speed manual is smooth most of the time but it can be a bit clunky and temperamental at times. That might just be the driver though. The only negative I have about the car is the insane amount of brake dust coming from the Brembo brakes. I wash the car and clean the wheels and within 20 miles the wheels are covered with dust and darker than the rear wheels. It wipes right off but it's a pain. GREAT MUSCLE CAR!!!"
