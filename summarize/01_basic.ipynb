       "[Document(page_content='How  This Book Was Written—And Why  \\n \\n \\nDuring the first thirty-five years of t he twentieth cent ury, the publ ishing houses of Am erica pri nted \\nmore than a fifth of a m illion different  books. Most of them  were deadly dull,  and m any were financial failures. \\n“Many,” did I say ? The presi dent of one of t he largest  publ ishing houses i n the worl d confessed t o me that his \\ncompany, after seventy-five years of  publishing experience, still lost m oney on seven out of every eight books it \\npublished. \\n \\nWhy, then, did I have the tem erity to write anot her book?  And, after I had written it, why should you \\nbother to read i t? \\n \\nFair quest ions, bot h; and I’l l try to answer t hem. \\n \\nI have, si nce 1912, been conduct ing educat ional cour ses for busi ness and professi onal men and wom en \\nin New York. At  first, I conduct ed courses i n publ ic speaking onl y—courses desi gned t o train adul ts, by actual \\nexperience, to think on their feet and express their ideas with m ore clarity , more effectiveness and m ore poise, \\nboth in busi ness interviews and before groups. \\n \\nBut gradual ly, as the seasons passed, I realized that as sorely  as these adults needed  train ing in effectiv e \\nspeaking, they needed still more training in the fine art of getting along with people in everyday business and \\nsocial contacts. \\n \\nI also gradual ly realized t hat I was sorel y in need  of such t raining m yself. As I l ook back across t he \\nyears, I am  appal led at my own frequent  lack of fi nesse and underst anding. How I wi sh a book such as t his had \\nbeen placed in m y hands twenty years ago!  What a priceless boon it would have been. \\n \\nDealing with people is probably the biggest problem  you face, especially  if you are in business. Yes, \\nand t hat is also true if you are a housewi fe, archi tect or engi neer. R esearch done a few y ears ago under t he \\nauspices of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advan cement of Teaching uncovered a m ost im portant and \\nsignificant fact—a fact later confirm ed by additional studies m ade at th e Carnegie Institute of Technology. \\nThese i nvest igations reveal ed that even i n such t echnical lines as engi neeri ng, about  15 percent  of one’s \\nfinancial success is due to one’s tec hnical knowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in hum an engineering, \\nto personality an d the ability to  lead  people. \\n \\nFor m any years, I conducted course s each season at the Engineers’ Club of Philadelphia, and also \\ncourses fo r the New Yo rk Chapter of the Am erican  Institute of Electrical En gineers. A to tal of probably more \\nthan fifteen hundred engineers have passed through m y classes. They cam e to me because they had finally \\nrealized, aft er years of observat ion and experi ence, t hat the highest -paid personnel  in engi neeri ng are frequent ly \\nnot those who know the m ost about engineering. One can for exam ple, hire m ere technical ability in \\nengineeri ng, account ancy , archi tecture or any  other professi on at  nom inal salaries. B ut the person who has \\ntechnical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to  assum e leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm  among \\npeopl e—that person i s headed for hi gher earni ng power. \\n \\nIn the heyday of his activity, John D. Rockefeller sa id that “the ability to deal with people is as \\npurchasable a com modity as sugar or coffee.” “And I will pay m ore for that ability,” said John D., “than for any \\nother under t he sun.” \\n \\nWouldn’t you suppose t hat every  college in the land woul d conduct  courses t o devel op the highest -\\npriced ability under the sun?  But if ther e is just one practical, com monsense c ourse of that kind given for adults \\nin even one college in the lan d, it has escap ed my atten tion up to the present writin g. \\n \\nThe Uni versity of C hicago and t he Uni ted Y.M .C.A. School s conduct ed a survey  to determine what  \\nadults want  to study. \\n \\nThat survey  cost $25,000 and t ook t wo years. The l ast part of the survey  was m ade in Meriden, \\nConnect icut. It had been chosen as  a typ ical Am erican  town. Every ad ult in Merid en was in terviewed  and \\nrequest ed to answer 156 quest ions—quest ions such as “W hat is your busi ness or professi on? Your educat ion? \\nHow do you spend your spare tim e? What is your in come? Your hobbies?  Your am bitions?  Your problem s? \\nWhat subject s are y ou m ost interested in studying?” And so  on. That survey revealed that health  is th e prime \\n 5', metadata={'source': 'how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

They  \\nsearched diligently for a pr actical textbook on the subject and found not one. Finally they  approached one of the \\nworld’s outstanding authorities on adult education and asked him  if he knew of any book that m et the needs of \\nthis group. “No,” he replied, \"I know what those adu lts want. But the book they need has never been written.” \\n \\nI knew from  experience that this statem ent was true , for I m yself had been searching for years to \\ndiscover a pract ical, worki ng handbook on hum an rel ations. \\n \\nSince no such book exi sted, I have t ried to write one for use i n my own courses. And here i t is. I hope \\nyou like it. \\n \\nIn preparat ion for t his book, I read every thing that I coul d find on t he subject —every thing from  \\nnewspaper col umns, magazine art icles, records of t he family court s, the wri tings of t he old phi losophers and t he \\nnew psy chologists.

W e read t heir biographi es; we read  the life sto ries of all g reat leaders from  Julius Caesar \\nto Thom as Edi son. I recal l that we read over one hundr ed bi ographi es of Theodore R oosevel t alone. W e were \\ndetermined to spare no t ime, no expense, t o discover every  pract ical idea that anyone had ever used t hroughout  \\nthe ages for wi nning fri ends and i nfluenci ng peopl e. \\n \\nI personal ly interviewed scores of successful  peopl e, som e of them worl d-fam ous i nvent ors like \\nMarco ni and Edison; political lead ers lik e Fran klin D. Ro osevelt an d James Farley; b usiness lead ers lik e Owen  \\nD. Young;  movie stars like Clark Gabl e and M ary Pickford, and expl orers l ike Martin Johnson, and t ried to \\ndiscover t he techni ques t hey used i n hum an rel ations. \\n \\nFrom all th is material, I p repared a short talk . I called  it “Ho w to Win Frien ds and Influence Peo ple”. I \\nsay “short .” It was short  in the begi nning, but  it soon e xpanded t o a lecture that consum ed one hour and t hirty \\nminutes. For years, I gave this talk each season to the adults in the Carnegie Ins titute courses in New York. \\n \\nI gave t he talk and urged t he listeners t o go out  and t est it in  their business an d social contacts, and then \\ncome back t o class and speak about  their experi ences a nd the resul ts they had achi eved. W hat an interesting \\nassignment! These m en and wom en, hungry  for sel f-improvem ent, were fasci nated by  the idea of worki ng in a \\nnew ki nd of l aborat ory—the first and onl y laborat ory of hum an rel ationshi ps for adul ts that had ever exi sted. \\n \\nThis book wasn’t written in the usual sense of the word. It grew as a child grows. It grew and \\ndevel oped out  of that laborat ory, out of the experi ences of t housands of adul ts. \\n \\nYears ago, we started with a set of rul es printed on a card no l arger t han a post card. The next  season we \\nprinted a larger card, then a leaflet,  then a series of booklets, each one e xpanding in size and sc ope. After fifteen \\nyears of experi ment and research cam e this book. \\n \\nThe rul es we have set  down here are not  mere theories or guesswork. They  work l ike magic. Incredi ble \\nas it sounds, I have seen the application of these prin ciples literally revolutionize the lives of m any people. \\n \\nTo illustrate: A m an with 314 em ployees joined one of  these courses. For years, he had driven and \\ncriticized and condem ned his em ployees without stint or discretion. Kindness, words of appreciation and \\nencouragem ent were al ien to his lips. Aft er studying the principles discussed i n this book, t his employer sharpl y \\naltered hi s phi losophy  of life. Hi s organi zation is now i nspired wi th a new l oyalty, a new ent husiasm, a new \\nspirit of teamwork. Three hundred and fourt een enem ies have been t urned i nto 314 fri ends.

       " Document(page_content='Nine Suggestions On How  To Get The Most Out Of This Book \\n \\n \\n1. If you wi sh to get the most out of this book, t here is one i ndispensabl e requi rement, one essent ial infinitely \\nmore important than any  rule or techni que. Unl ess you have t his one fundam ental requi site, a thousand rules \\non how to study will avail little, and if you do have th is cardinal endowm ent, then you can achieve wonders \\nwithout reading any suggestions fo r getting the m ost out of a book. \\n \\nWhat is this magic requi rement? Just this: a deep, dri ving desi re to learn, a vi gorous det ermination to \\nincrease yo ur ability to  deal with  people. \\n \\nHow can you devel op such an urge?  By const antly reminding yoursel f how i mportant these pri nciples are t o \\nyou. Pictu re to yourself h ow their m astery will aid  you in lead ing a rich er, fu ller, h appier an d more \\nfulfilling life. Say to yourself over and over: “My popul arity, m y happiness and sense of worth depend to no \\nsmall extent upon m y skill in dealing with people.” \\n \\n2. Read each chapter rapidly at first to get a bird’s-eye view of it. You will probably be tem pted then to rush \\non to the next  one. B ut don’t , unless y ou are readi ng m erely for ent ertainment. But if you are readi ng \\nbecause you want to increase your  skill in hum an relations, then go back and reread each chapter \\nthoroughly. In the long run, this w ill mean saving tim e and getting results. \\n \\n3. Stop frequent ly in your readi ng to think over what  you are readi ng. Ask y oursel f just how and when y ou \\ncan apply each suggestion. \\n \\n4. Read wi th a cray on, penci l, pen, m agic marker or hi ghlighter in your hand. W hen you com e across a \\nsuggest ion that you feel  you can use, draw a l ine besi de it. If it is a four-st ar suggest ion, then underscore \\nevery  sentence or hi ghlight it, or m ark it with “****”. M arking and underscori ng a book m akes it more \\ninterestin g, and far easie r to review rapidly . \\n \\n5. I knew a wom an who had been offi ce m anager for a l arge insurance concern for fi fteen y ears. Every  month, \\nshe read all the insurance contracts her com pany had issued that m onth. Yes, she read m any of the sam e \\ncontracts over m onth after m onth, y ear after year. W hy? Because experi ence had taught her that that was \\nthe onl y way  she coul d keep t heir provi sions cl early in mind. \\n \\nI once spent  almost two years wri ting a book on publ ic speaki ng and y et I found I had t o keep goi ng back \\nover it from  time to tim e in order to rem ember what I had written in m y own book. The rapidity with which \\nwe forget  is astonishing. \\n \\nSo, if you want  to get a real , lasting benefi t out of this book, don’t  imagine that skimming through i t once \\nwill suffice. After reading it thoroughl y, you ought to spend a few hours re viewing it every m onth. Keep it \\non your desk i n front  of you every  day. Glance t hrough i t often. Keep const antly impressi ng yoursel f with \\nthe rich  possibilities fo r improvement that still lie in  the offing. Rem ember that the use of these p rinciples \\ncan be m ade habi tual only by a const ant and vi gorous  cam paign of revi ew and appl ication. There i s no \\nother way . \\n \\n6. Bernard Shaw once rem arked, “If you teach a m an anything, he will never learn. ” Shaw was right. Learning \\nis an act ive process. W e learn by  doing. So, i f you desi re to master the principles you are st udying in this \\nbook, do som ething about them . Apply these rules at every opportunity. If you don’t you will forget them  \\nquickly. Onl y knowl edge t hat is used st icks in your m ind. \\n \\nYou will probably find it difficult to apply these sugges tions all the tim e. I know because I wrote the book, \\nand y et frequent ly I found i t difficult to appl y every thing I advocat ed. For exam ple, when y ou are \\ndispleased, it is m uch easier to criticize and condem n than it is to try to understand the other person’s \\nviewpoi nt. It is frequent ly easier to find faul t than to find prai se. It  is more nat ural to talk about  what  you \\nwant  than to talk about  what  the other person want s and so on. So, as y ou read t his book, remember that you \\nare not  merely trying to acqui re inform ation. You are at tempting to form  new habi ts. Ah y es, you are \\nattem pting a new way o f life. Th at will req uire tim e and persisten ce an d daily ap plicatio n. \\n \\nSo refer to these pages oft en.

Learning is an active process, so it is important to apply the principles in real life situations.

       "Document(page_content='How  This Book Was Written—And Why  \\n \\n \\nDuring the first thirty-five years of t he twentieth cent ury, the publ ishing houses of Am erica pri nted \\nmore than a fifth of a m illion different  books. Most of them  were deadly dull,  and m any were financial failures. \\n“Many,” did I say ? The presi dent of one of t he largest  publ ishing houses i n the worl d confessed t o me that his \\ncompany, after seventy-five years of  publishing experience, still lost m oney on seven out of every eight books it \\npublished. \\n \\nWhy, then, did I have the tem erity to write anot her book?  And, after I had written it, why should you \\nbother to read i t? \\n \\nFair quest ions, bot h; and I’l l try to answer t hem. \\n \\nI have, si nce 1912, been conduct ing educat ional cour ses for busi ness and professi onal men and wom en \\nin New York. At  first, I conduct ed courses i n publ ic speaking onl y—courses desi gned t o train adul ts, by actual \\nexperience, to think on their feet and express their ideas with m ore clarity , more effectiveness and m ore poise, \\nboth in busi ness interviews and before groups. \\n \\nBut gradual ly, as the seasons passed, I realized that as sorely  as these adults needed  train ing in effectiv e \\nspeaking, they needed still more training in the fine art of getting along with people in everyday business and \\nsocial contacts. \\n \\nI also gradual ly realized t hat I was sorel y in need  of such t raining m yself. As I l ook back across t he \\nyears, I am  appal led at my own frequent  lack of fi nesse and underst anding. How I wi sh a book such as t his had \\nbeen placed in m y hands twenty years ago!  What a priceless boon it would have been. \\n \\nDealing with people is probably the biggest problem  you face, especially  if you are in business. Yes, \\nand t hat is also true if you are a housewi fe, archi tect or engi neer. R esearch done a few y ears ago under t he \\nauspices of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advan cement of Teaching uncovered a m ost im portant and \\nsignificant fact—a fact later confirm ed by additional studies m ade at th e Carnegie Institute of Technology. \\nThese i nvest igations reveal ed that even i n such t echnical lines as engi neeri ng, about  15 percent  of one’s \\nfinancial success is due to one’s tec hnical knowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in hum an engineering, \\nto personality an d the ability to  lead  people. \\n \\nFor m any years, I conducted course s each season at the Engineers’ Club of Philadelphia, and also \\ncourses fo r the New Yo rk Chapter of the Am erican  Institute of Electrical En gineers. A to tal of probably more \\nthan fifteen hundred engineers have passed through m y classes. They cam e to me because they had finally \\nrealized, aft er years of observat ion and experi ence, t hat the highest -paid personnel  in engi neeri ng are frequent ly \\nnot those who know the m ost about engineering. One can for exam ple, hire m ere technical ability in \\nengineeri ng, account ancy , archi tecture or any  other professi on at  nom inal salaries. B ut the person who has \\ntechnical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to  assum e leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm  among \\npeopl e—that person i s headed for hi gher earni ng power. \\n \\nIn the heyday of his activity, John D. Rockefeller sa id that “the ability to deal with people is as \\npurchasable a com modity as sugar or coffee.” “And I will pay m ore for that ability,” said John D., “than for any \\nother under t he sun.” \\n \\nWouldn’t you suppose t hat every  college in the land woul d conduct  courses t o devel op the highest -\\npriced ability under the sun?  But if ther e is just one practical, com monsense c ourse of that kind given for adults \\nin even one college in the lan d, it has escap ed my atten tion up to the present writin g. \\n \\nThe Uni versity of C hicago and t he Uni ted Y.M .C.A. School s conduct ed a survey  to determine what  \\nadults want  to study. \\n \\nThat survey  cost $25,000 and t ook t wo years. The l ast part of the survey  was m ade in Meriden, \\nConnect icut. It had been chosen as  a typ ical Am erican  town. Every ad ult in Merid en was in terviewed  and \\nrequest ed to answer 156 quest ions—quest ions such as “W hat is your busi ness or professi on? Your educat ion? \\nHow do you spend your spare tim e? What is your in come? Your hobbies?  Your am bitions?  Your problem s? \\nWhat subject s are y ou m ost interested in studying?” And so  on. That survey revealed that health  is th e prime \\n 5', metadata={'source': 'how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.pdf', 'page': 5})"
